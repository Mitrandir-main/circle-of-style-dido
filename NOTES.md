Issues for future addressing

1. Card is not in Navigation bar and is not in global state that can be addressable
2. No pagination or lazy loading on products list. Not noticeable now because of few products, but will be a problem with more data.
3. filteredProducts constant should be a state.
4. Product Card hoover feels strange
5. Static props in index.tsx are not used in products page

Issues Fixed

1. Order of functions and constants in product page to more be intuitive
2. props in product card to be in interface

Implemented Features

1. Product Card Content to be clickable next Link to product page
2. Product Page that fetches the product api based on the id from params
