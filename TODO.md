## Early user feedback

-   There are not enough ways to filter products
    -   Time: 3hr
    -   It is not super clear on what is needed.
    -   Needed Info: What the current filters are? What user might have tried to filter? What the filter UX is?
    -   Priority: 4
-   There is no accessibility support for screen readers
    -   Time: 2hr
    -   Accessibility support is a must thing to do on every website. Many users can benefit from it.
    -   Needed Info: What places don't have Accessibility support in the product.
    -   Priority: 2
-   I can't search by product name
    -   Time: 2hr or 14hr
    -   It can be done very quick with frontend filtering, however the best way to do it is with backend api. Therefore it can be delivered in two stages.
    -   Needed Info: What might be the needed search? WHat part of product data would be searched from user? Do we have business benefit from user having to scroll and check out many products before finding the one they are searching for?
    -   Priority: 3 (for first stage)
-   I am seeing lot of products that are out of stock
    -   Time: 1hr
    -   It is very annoying experience and can even loose clients. It is very quick and easy to do.
    -   Needed Info: Where exactly the out of stock is visible, if it is after ordering, then it is possible the most annoying experience. If it is on product page, it is not that bad. Do we have business goal for showing out of stock - FOMO, etc.
    -   Priority: 1
-   I can't see my order history

    -   Time: 8hr - 13hr
    -   Seems like a nice feature to have, but negative experience is not much. It wont affect buying that much.
    -   Needed Info: Is there something special that might be done with order history?
    -   Priority: 5

-   For all feedback it will be very helpful to me to know the following things:
    -   Basic user profile data
    -   Analytics of user's usage, cohorts, timeline in product, etc. For instance we might want to focus on the users spending the most or inviting people the most.
    -   Maybe most important of all. What are the different user journeys for the different cohorts of users and therefore what is the end goal or KPI? If end goal is buying a product => all feedback addressing should be done for the goal improvement. MIght also be inviting people, buying large amounts, etc.

## Feature backlog

-   Some of our API integrations have the credentials hard-coded into our private repository
-   We need to display the product image in the cart
-   One of our testers reported a crash that recurs once every few days. Cursory investigation hasn't been able to reproduce the issue
-   Users on mobile should be able to remove items from their cart with intuitive swipe gestures
-   Users should be able to favourite products they like
-   The Cart button should be contained within the Navbar and visible on every page
-   Once a customer checks out we need to display a receipt in PDF format that comes from from our third-party inventory management system
