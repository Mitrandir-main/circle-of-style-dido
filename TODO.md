    -   Accessibility support is a must thing to do on every website. Many users can benefit from it.

-   I can't search by product name
    -   Time: 2hr or 14hr
    -   It can be done very quick with frontend filtering, however the best way to do it is with backend api. Therefore it can be delivered in two stages.

    -   Priority: 3 (for first stage)
-   I am seeing lot of products that are out of stock
    -   Time: 1hr
    -   It is very annoying experience and can even loose clients. It is very quick and easy to do.
    -   Needed Info:
    -   Priority: 1
-   I can't see my order history
    -   Time: 8hr - 13hr
    -   Seems like a nice feature to have, but negative experience is not much. It wont affect buying that much.

    -   Priority: 5

## Feature backlog

-   Some of our API integrations have the credentials hard-coded into our private repository
-   We need to display the product image in the cart
-   One of our testers reported a crash that recurs once every few days. Cursory investigation hasn't been able to reproduce the issue
-   Users on mobile should be able to remove items from their cart with intuitive swipe gestures
-   Users should be able to favourite products they like
-   The Cart button should be contained within the Navbar and visible on every page
-   Once a customer checks out we need to display a receipt in PDF format that comes from from our third-party inventory management system
